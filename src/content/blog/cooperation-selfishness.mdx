A messy roommate who doesn't cleanup after guests. A significant other who doesn't take out the trash. 
A sibling that clutters the bathroom counter. We've all encountered (or will encounter) one of these people in our lives: 
those that unknowningly or otherwise take advantage of shared communal resources. Can these types' menacing behaviors be explained 
by rational methods or will their ways forever evade the good Samaritans of the household? In this blog series, we will use 
economic analysis to shed light on the incentives of cooperation and selfishness and perhaps learn something about ourselves and 
others in the process. Later in the series, we will breach out from the household and analyze cooperation and selfishness 
on a global scale: pollution, climate change, and various other issues involving communal resources.

In this article, we'll cover various economic concepts such as:
- Utility functions
- Opportunity Cost
- Game Theory

We'll begin with a few core concepts of economics and continue on to the rest of the article. 

Beware, this is an article that features math, the (especially) boring details are hidden behind dropdowns where the interested reader 
can dive deeper if they so choose.

# Core Concepts

## Utility

The single core concept of the study of economics is **utility**. You can think of utility as happiness. The more utility the better. 
It is assumed to be the *one* thing economic agents strive to maximize. Economists' notion of utility is roughly modelled 
to account for real-life facts: that as you consume or do one particular thing, your increase in utility decreases. Every cookie 
after the first brings less happiness and may even make you unhappy.

A very common **utility function** is the [logarithm function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) (log for short):
<Latex formula='u(x) = \log(x)'/>

<br/>
<Image src={LogImage} alt="Log function graph"/>
<br/><br/>

which we can see seems to level off as <Latex formula='x' inline={true}/> gets large. Many other functions will work but the mathematical 
ease-of-use of the log function makes it a very popular choice.

## Opportunity Cost

The next core concept of economics is **opportunity cost** which stems from the idea of limited resources. Choosing to use your farm for 
apples means that you cannot also use it for wheat. You can eat an apple or an orange but you'll only have so much space in your stomach. 
We can augment our utility function to take account of this concept:

<Latex formula='u(x,y) = \log(x) + \log(y)'/>
subject to
<Latex formula='x+y=A'/>
<br/>

Let's say <Latex formula='x' inline={true}/> is for apples and <Latex formula='y' inline={true}/> is for oranges. So we can see 
that consuming either apples or oranges gives us utility, however, notice the new constraint: we can only eat 
an amount <Latex formula='A' inline={true}/> of either apples or oranges.

For example, say we can only eat 10 apples or oranges and let's use the new constraint to simplify our utility function to be a 
function of only <Latex formula='x' inline={true}/> the number of apples we eat.

<Latex formula='u(x) = \log(x) + \log(10-x)'/>
<br/>
<Image src={MultivarUtilityImage} alt="Multivariable Utility Graph"/>
<br/><br/>

Due to the symmetry of our utility function, we can clearly see it is maximized when we eat 5 apples and 5 oranges.

### Preferences
What happens if we like apples slightly more than oranges? We can add multipliers to the components of our utility function:

<Latex formula='u(x,y) = \alpha \log(x) + \beta \log(y)'/>
<br/>

<Latex formula='\alpha / \beta' inline={true}/> is how many times more we like apples over oranges and vice versa.

For example, say <Latex formula='\alpha = 0.75' inline={true}/> and <Latex formula='\beta = 0.25' inline={true}/>. That means 
I like apples 3 times more than oranges. Taking into account opportunity cost like above and assuming I can only eat 10 apples or oranges 
our utility function now looks like: 

<Latex formula='u(x) = 0.75\log(x) + 0.25\log(10-x)'/>
<br/>
<Image src={MultivarUtilityPrefImage} alt="Multivariable Utility with Preferences Graph"/>
<br/><br/>

which is maximized when I eat 7.5 apples and 2.5 oranges. If I like apples 3 times more than oranges, I will eat 3 times 
as many.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="Dive Deeper: The Math Behind Opportunity Cost & Utility Optimization">
    To optimize for utility with respect to the inputs, economists are concerned with finding the points of *indifference*. 
    That is, the allocation of the inputs such that no one component has an "edge" over the other.

    If you know calculus, this might sound oddly like a [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) (aka sensitivity to change) 
    where we are concerned with finding the 0's of a derivate (aka a critical point).

    I like to think of practical interpretations of this mathematical concept: you will consume items or engage in various activities but 
    generally will spread out your time and money so that each component of your utility is given as much input as the effect on your 
    total output (utility) is called for.

# A Simple Household

Now the fun part, let's consider Alice and Bob, two young adults living together splitting chores. Let's construct utility functions 
for both of them by considering two activities that either of them can engage in: chores or leisure. However, there is a twist: the chores
are *communal* meaning Bob will still gain utility from a clean house even if Alice does the chores.

Let's say <Latex formula='c' inline={true}/> is the time spent on doing chores, 
<Latex formula='l' inline={true}/> for time spent on leisure, in general subscripting 
Alice's variables with <Latex formula='A' inline={true}/>, Bob's variables with <Latex formula='B' inline={true}/>, 
and the sum of Alice and Bob's variables with <Latex formula='T' inline={true}/> when there could be ambiguity.

Then the utility function for Alice would be

<Latex formula='u_A(c,l)=\alpha \log(c + c_B) + \beta \log(l)'/> 
<br/>

Assuming that both of them have 100 hours to spend between leisure or chores, let's rewrite this as

<Latex formula='u_A(c)=\alpha \log(c + c_B) + \beta \log(100 - c)'/> 
<br/>

## Cooperative Utopia
Let's say Bob has preferences <Latex formula='\alpha_B = 0.25' inline={true}/> and <Latex formula='\beta_B = 0.75' inline={true}/> 
(preferring leisure) and Alice has preferences <Latex formula='\alpha_A = 0.5' inline={true}/> and 
<Latex formula='\beta_A = 0.5' inline={true}/> (evenly split). 

Using similar logic to the first section of this article, we can solve for the time allocation that maximizes total household utility 
(the sum of both their utilities <Latex formula='u_A + u_B' inline={true}/>):

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="Derivation: Total Household Utility Optimization">
    We can reduce this problem by combining Alice and Bob's time so that
    <Latex formula='c_T + l_T=2A'/>
    <br/>

    and solving 
    <Latex formula='u_T(c_T)=\alpha_T\log(c_T) + \beta_T\log(2A-c_T)'/>
    <br/>

    gives that <Latex formula='c_T=(\alpha_A+\alpha_B)\times A' inline={true}/>.

    Now, looking at the combined utility again using <Latex formula='c_A + c_B = c_T' inline={true}/> we get

    <Latex formula='u_T(c_A)=u_A(c_A,A-c_A) + u_B(c_T-c_A, A-(c_T-c_A))'/>
    <br/>

    which is a utility function of one variable which we solved in a section above. 
    
    (We can combine the utility functions and talk about this new one as written here due to the nice properties of the log function 
    as mentioned but this general result will hold via traditional optimization which we go over in a later section.)
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

which turns out to be <Latex formula='c_B=25' inline={true}/> and <Latex formula='c_A=50' inline={true}/>. 

Bob spending 25 hours on chores and 75 hours on 
leisure; Alice spending 50 hours on chores and 50 hours on leisure. Everyone happy.

## Bob the Slob
However, there's a problem with our utopia (shocker).

Let's take a closer look at Bob's utility function
<Latex formula='u_B(c)=\alpha \log(c_A + c) + \beta \log(100 - c)'/> 
<br/>

Assuming Alice does the optimal amount of 50 hours of chores, Bob's utility function becomes
<Latex formula='u_B(c)=0.25\log(50 + c) + 0.75\log(100 - c)'/> 
<br/>

<br/>
<Image src={BobFixedAliceImage} alt="Bob's utility function with Alice doing 50 hours of chores"/>
<br/><br/>

which is maximized when Bob does **0 hours** of chores. Less than if he lived alone! 

This is because Alice is already doing 50 hours of chores: more than what Bob "prefers" should be done. This outcome is "stable" 
as well: knowing Bob's time allocation, Alice should still do 50 hours of chores to maximize her own personal utility while Bob 
spends all his time on leisure.

So what's happening?

## Game Theory

Game theory is the study of economic agents whose utility functions not only depend on their own actions but other agents' actions as well, 
much like how Alice and Bob's optimal time allocations depend on each other. We'll have another article that examples game theory in depth, 
but we'll cover the basics now to handle this chore dispute with Alice and Bob.

At the heart of game theory is [**Pareto efficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) outcomes, which are outcomes 
like Alice and Bob's above where the agents do not wish to switch their actions even knowing the other one's choice. Let's take a look 
at two little-known firms Coca-Cola and Pepsi for an example.

### Coca-Cola & Pepsi

A very common technique of game theory is to draw a table to find the Pareto efficient outcomes. Let's say Coca-Cola and Pepsi want to 
advertise their drink products. 
- If neither of them advertise, consumers will continue to buy their preferred brand. 
- If only one of them advertises, they will be dominate the market as consumers have one brand on their mind. 
- However, if both of them advertise, consumers are back to square one, except this time both brands have to pay for 
their expensive marketing campaigns. 

We can capture these scenarios in a payout table.

Let's say Coca-Cola is the column-player, Pepsi is the row-player. Each cell is formatted as \<column player reward\> / \<row player reward\>.

|                     | Don't Advertise | Advertise |
| -----------------   | --------------- | --------- |
| **Don't Advertise** | 500 / 450       | 250 / 650 |
| **Advertise**       | 750 / 150       | 475 / 425 |
<br/>

Let's put ourselves in Coca-Cola's shoes to decide as a business what should be done. 
- If Pepsi doesn't Advertise (first column), then 500 vs 750 means that we should Advertise.
- If Pepsi Advertises (second column), then 250 vs 475 means that we should Advertise.

So, Coca-Cola should Advertise regardless of action by Pepsi and vice versa!

The **Pareto efficient** outcome in this scenario is that **both companies advertise**, even though they both could make more money 
if they both didn't advertise. 

Fascinating enough, companies in real life faced with similar game theory problems 
agree to **cooperate** with each other to achieve outcomes that increase both parties' profits. (This is oftentimes 
heavily regulated as this is potentially illegal collusion which hurts consumers.)

### Alice & Bob

Let's see if we can apply what we learned to Alice and Bob.

Notice that Bob's utility function in the last section *depends on* Alice's time allocation. In fact, given Alice's time allocation, we 
can figure out exactly how much time Bob should allocate to chores to maximize his utility (and vice versa).

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="Derivation: Closed-form Optimal Time Allocation">
    To find the optimal time allocation, we will find the solution of *indifference*. That is, the allocation that Bob will be equally 
    happy spending the next hour on leisure or chores.

    Recall Bob's utility function

    <Latex formula='u_B(c)=\alpha\log(c_A + c) + \beta\log(A - c)'/> 
    <br/>

    We set the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) (aka sensitivity to change) equal to 0 to find the point of 
    indifference.
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} \ddfrac{d}{dc}[u_B(c)]=\ddfrac{\alpha}{c_A+ c} - \ddfrac{\beta}{A - c}=0 \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} \ddfrac{\alpha}{c_A+ c} = \ddfrac{\beta}{A - c} \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} \alpha A - \alpha c = \beta c_A + \beta c \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} \alpha A - \beta c_A  = \alpha c + \beta c  \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} \alpha A - \beta c_A  = (\alpha + \beta) c \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='c=\alpha A - \beta c_A'/>
    <br/>

    Then, plugging in <Latex inline={true} formula='A=100\text{,~}\alpha=0.25\text{,~}\beta=0.75'/>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

<Latex formula='c_B=25 - 0.75c_A'/>
<Latex formula='c_A=50 - 0.5c_B'/>

<br/>

It's possible for Alice to be spiteful and spend all her time on leisure, forcing Bob to spend 25 hours on chores. 
(However, this would not maximize Alice's utility. In general, economists assume that economic agents are **rational**, 
always trying to maximize their personal utility. There is a whole field of economics that studies *irrational* agents and 
its implications.)

So knowing that Alice's optimal time allocation depends on his own time allocation, Bob can solve for the Pareto efficient outcome: 

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem header="Derivation: Pareto Efficient Chore Outcome">
    Using the conditional optimal time allocations from above
    <Latex formula='c_B=A\alpha_B - \beta_Bc_A'/>
    <Latex formula='c_A=A\alpha_A- \beta_Ac_B'/>
    <br/>

    We can plug one in to the other

    <Latex formula='c_B=A\alpha_B - \beta_B(A\alpha_A- \beta_Ac_B) \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='c_B=A\alpha_B - A\alpha_A\beta_B + \beta_A\beta_Bc_B \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='c_B - \beta_A\beta_Bc_B=A\alpha_B - A\alpha_A\beta_B \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='(1 - \beta_A\beta_B)c_B=A\alpha_B - A\alpha_A\beta_B \implies'/>
    <Latex formula='\newcommand\ddfrac[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}} c_B=A\ddfrac{\alpha_B - \alpha_A\beta_B}{1 - \beta_A\beta_B}'/>
    <br/>

    Then, plugging in <Latex inline={true} formula='A=100\text{,~}\alpha_B=0.25\text{,~}\beta_B=0.75\text{,~}\alpha_A=0.5\text{,~}\beta_A=0.5'/>
    <Latex formula='c_B=-20'/>
    <br/>

    However, time has to be positive, so <Latex inline={true} formula='c_B=0'/>
    
    Plugging this in to Alice's equation we get <Latex inline={true} formula='c_A=50'/>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

which we saw before resulted in

<Latex formula='c_B=0 \text{,~~} l_B=100'/>
<Latex formula='c_A=50 \text{,~~} l_A=50'/>
<br/>

Bob does 0 hours of chores and Alice does 50 hours of chores.

# Conclusion

In this article, we covered core concepts of economics including utility and opportunity cost, and touched on a little game theory. 
We applied these concepts to study a simple household that splits chores and learned something disconcerting: that the "lazy bums" 
we encounter in our lives are actually clever geniuses of game theory and are optimally maximizing their own personal utility (at 
the expense of the aggregate utility).

However, do not fret for real life examples show us that cooperation (such as in the case of companies' non-compete agreements) is 
possible and even necessary in scenarios such as our simple household. In the next part of this series, we will investigate possible 
remedies to Alice and Bob's utility functions so that even Bob the Slob with his resentment of chores will find it optimal to help out!
