A messy roommate who doesn't cleanup after guests. A significant other who doesn't take out the trash. 
A sibling that clutters the bathroom counter. We've all encountered (or will encounter) one of these people in our lives: 
those that unknowningly or otherwise take advantage of shared communal resources. Can these types' menacing behaviors be explained 
by rational methods or will their ways forever evade the good Samaritans of the household? In this blog series, we will use 
economic analysis to shed light on the incentives of cooperation (and selfishness) and perhaps learn something about ourselves and 
others in the process. Later in the series, we will breach out from the household and analyze cooperation (and selfishness) 
on a global scale: pollution, climate change, and various other issues involving communal resources.

# Utility

The single core concept of the study of economics is **utility**. Utility is happiness: the more utility the better. It is assumed 
to be the *one* thing economic agents strive to maximize. Economists' notion of utility is roughly modelled 
to account for real-life facts: that as you consume or do one particular thing, your increase in utility decreases. Every cookie 
after the first brings less happiness and may even make you unhappy.
